# Onify Blueprint: Create and update ticket in Freshservice

[Freshservice](https://freshservice.com/) is a modern ITSM tool from [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/). In this Blueprint we show how to first create a new ticket and then update the same ticket and last but not least we add a note to the ticket. Everyting is done through [Freshservice REST API](https://api.freshservice.com/).
